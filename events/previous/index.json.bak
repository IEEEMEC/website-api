        "description":"Linux is a popular Operating System, often used as an alternative to the widely used Windows. Understanding and working with LINUX stands as a criterion for many companies while seeking jobs. LINUX is also useful for programming as it's widely considered more professional.\nAnalysing the importance of familiarising with LINUX as an essential part of an engineer's skillset, IEEE MEC SB's CS Society is conducting a workshop on Linux and Debian packaging. Important topics such as Shell programming, Linux commands and file modification would be covered in the workshop. The workshop will include an introductory session, along with hands-on, interactive sessions. Different applications which run on Linux alternative to Windows would also be discussed.",
